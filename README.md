# Python Pandas

There execises are form lesson I found in the tutorial section of pandas.pydata.org back in 2018 (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18/tutorials.html).

Here is a guide:
Chapter 1: Reading your data into pandas is pretty much the easiest thing. Even when the encoding is wrong!

Chapter 2: It’s not totally obvious how to select data from a pandas dataframe. Here we explain the basics (how to take slices and get columns)

Chapter 3: Here we get into serious slicing and dicing and learn how to filter dataframes in complicated ways, really fast.

Chapter 4: Groupby/aggregate is seriously my favorite thing about pandas and I use it all the time. You should probably read this.

Chapter 5: Here you get to find out if it’s cold in Montreal in the winter (spoiler: yes). Web scraping with pandas is fun! Here we combine dataframes.

Chapter 6: Strings with pandas are great. It has all these vectorized string operations and they’re the best. We will turn a bunch of strings containing “Snow” into vectors of numbers in a trice.

Chapter 7: Cleaning up messy data is never a joy, but with pandas it’s easier.

Chapter 8: Parsing Unix timestamps is confusing at first but it turns out to be really easy.

As of 2020, they have changed it a bit.

I had trouble compiling some of there code on my machine at the time as I was using iPython Notebook not Jupyter. I had to make some adjustments to make them work.

So in general you can run through these examples to understande and manipulate large data sets using Python/Pandas in iPython Notebook.

Several different tutorials have been worked through in these files. This would be a great resource for anyone having trouble learning Pandas themselves.
