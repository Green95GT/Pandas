# Python Pandas Tutorials

There execises are form lesson I found in the tutorial section of pandas.pydata.org back in 2018 (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18/tutorials.html).

Here is a guide:

01 - Lesson: - Importing libraries - Creating data sets - Creating data frames - Reading from CSV - Exporting to CSV - Finding maximums - Plotting data

02 - Lesson: - Reading from TXT - Exporting to TXT - Selecting top/bottom records - Descriptive statistics - Grouping/sorting data

03 - Lesson: - Creating functions - Reading from EXCEL - Exporting to EXCEL - Outliers - Lambda functions - Slice and dice data

04 - Lesson: - Adding/deleting columns - Index operations

05 - Lesson: - Stack/Unstack/Transpose functions

06 - Lesson: - GroupBy function

07 - Lesson: - Ways to calculate outliers

08 - Lesson: - Read from Microsoft SQL databases

09 - Lesson: - Export to CSV/EXCEL/TXT

10 - Lesson: - Converting between different kinds of formats

11 - Lesson: - Combining data from various sources

Lessons 8 & 9 are missing.

Then there are the cookbook exercises that I managed to do. However the iPython files are missing so these are in txt format:

Chapter 5: Here you get to find out if it’s cold in Montreal in the winter (spoiler: yes). Web scraping with pandas is fun! Here we                combine dataframes.

Chapter 6: Strings with pandas are great. It has all these vectorized string operations and they’re the best. We will turn a bunch of              strings containing “Snow” into vectors of numbers in a trice.

Chapter 7: Cleaning up messy data is never a joy, but with pandas it’s easier.

And finally I did the Practical Data Analysis with Python sectoin (Munging, Aggregating, Visualizing, and Time Series).

I had trouble compiling some of there code on my machine at the time as I was using iPython Notebook not Jupyter. I had to make some adjustments to make them work.

So in general you can run through these examples to understande and manipulate large data sets using Python/Pandas in iPython Notebook.

Several different tutorials have been worked through in these files. This would be a great resource for anyone having trouble learning Pandas themselves.
